                        The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Friars_Minor" style="text-decoration: none; color: rgb(209, 166, 85);" >Order of Friars Minor (OFM)</a>, founded by St. Francis of Assisi in 1209, is a Catholic religious community called to live the Gospel through a life of fraternity, simplicity, and poverty. Rooted in a deep love for Christ, the friars are inspired by St. Francis' radical embrace of the poor and the marginalized, his reverence for creation, and his unwavering devotion to the Church.
                        <br><br> the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ofmsouthphil" style="text-decoration: none; color: rgb(209, 166, 85);">Province of San Antonio de Padua – Philippines</a>, which was joyfully elevated to provincehood in April 2023, this Franciscan spirit continues to flourish. The friars embody their calling by living among the people, particularly the poor and those on the peripheries, embracing a life of minority—a spiritual attitude of humility, openness, and servant leadership. Their presence is a quiet yet powerful witness to the Gospel values in today’s world marked by materialism, individualism, and ecological disregard.
                        <br><br>The friars serve in diverse ministries: from parishes and formation houses to schools, and mission areas—both urban and rural. In each of these, they bring the warmth of fraternity and the clarity of the Gospel. They also engage in justice, peace, and integrity of creation (JPIC) initiatives, reflecting their commitment to the care of our common home and solidarity with the oppressed.
                        <br><br>As sons of St. Francis, they strive to be instruments of peace, joy, and renewal—walking alongside the people with the heart of a brother, proclaiming not only with words but with their lives: Pax et Bonum! (Peace and Goodness!).

                        Brothers Kyle R. Castañares, OFMNov of Pintuyan, Southern Leyte; Terence Visbal, OFMNov of Caibiran, Biliran; 
                        Ian Roy L. Delastrico, OFMNov; and Jake B. Goles, OFMNov of Tagoloan, Misamis Oriental will soon profess their 
                        temporary vows in the Order of Friars Minor – Franciscans, under the Province of San Antonio de Padua - Philippines.

                        This sacred moment marks the fruit of their year-long novitiate formation—a time set apart from the world, 
                        rich in silence, prayer, study, fraternity, and interior transformation. The novitiate is often described as the 
                        <em class="fst-italic text-warning">school of the heart</em>, where one is gradually stripped of old habits and worldly attachments to make room for 
                        the Gospel way of life according to St. Francis of Assisi.
                    </p>
                    <p style="color: rgb(218, 213, 213);">
                        The journey was not without its share of sweet and bitter moments. There were days of clarity, joy, and affirmation—where community life, 
                        nature, and God’s presence brought deep peace. Yet there were also silent battles: inner struggles with ego, doubts, and fears; the challenge 
                        of letting go of control; the test of obedience and humility; and the quiet pain of confronting one’s limitations.
                    </p>
                    <p style="color: rgb(218, 213, 213);">
                        Each moment—whether consoling or purifying—became an essential stone in the foundation of their vocation. The novitiate taught them not only 
                        how to pray and live in community but more importantly, how to listen to the voice of the Crucified, who calls them daily to die to self and rise 
                        with Christ in the service of others.
                    </p>
                    <p style="color: rgb(218, 213, 213);">
                        Now, as they profess their first vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience, they formally enter the Franciscan life, not as guests, but as 
                        brothers committed to walking in the footsteps of the Poor Christ. Their vows, to be renewed annually until their solemn profession, 
                        are not mere rituals but living promises—embraced through grace and lived out in mission.
                    </p>
                    <p style="color: rgb(218, 213, 213);">
                        Let us continue to support these brothers with our prayers as they take this courageous step forward. May their novitiate 
                        experience—marked by joy, trial, and transformation—serve as a firm foundation for their future life as full-fledged Friars Minor, 
                        faithful to the Gospel and the charism of St. Francis.

                        “Praised be You, my Lord, through Sister Mother Earth, who sustains and governs us…” – St. Francis of Assisi, <em>Canticle of the Creatures</em>
                    </p>

                    <p style="color: rgb(218, 213, 213);">
                        As Franciscans, we are sons and daughters of the Poverello of Assisi — the little brother who saw the whole cosmos as a family: sun and moon, fire and water, creatures great and small. In Sister Mother Earth, he did not see a resource to be exploited, but a beloved companion in the sacred journey of life. Today, we are called to awaken that same spirit as we enter the Jubilee for the Season of Creation.
                    </p>

                    <p style="color: rgb(218, 213, 213);">
                        A Jubilee is a time of rest, restoration, and return — a sacred pause to realign our hearts and our communities with God’s vision of justice and peace. And so, we pause — to listen to the cry of the Earth and the cry of the poor, which have grown louder and more desperate.
                    </p>

                    <p style="color: rgb(218, 213, 213);">
                        We are witnesses to devastating wildfires, rising seas, melting glaciers, and toxic air. Forests are stripped bare, rivers are poisoned, and countless species are silenced forever. The wounds of the Earth mirror the wounds of our own souls: a disconnection from the Divine Source and a rupture in our relationships — with God, with one another, and with all of creation.
                    </p>

                    <p style="color: rgb(218, 213, 213);">
                        St. Francis teaches us that all of creation bears the imprint of God — that the Earth is not a backdrop to our salvation story, but a central character. He embraced lepers and lepers of the land alike — those cast aside, polluted, and left to decay. How then can we claim to follow Christ in the footsteps of Francis if we do not also embrace the groaning of our suffering planet?
                    </p>

                    <p style="color: rgb(218, 213, 213);">
                        The Jubilee for the Season of Creation is more than a liturgical season; it is a call to conversion — ecological conversion. It invites us to simplicity, to contemplative presence, to humility — the kind that bows before the mystery of a seed, the dignity of a tree, the sacredness of water.
                    </p>

                    <p style="color: rgb(218, 213, 213);">
                        To live this Jubilee as Franciscans is to be prophetic in action and presence:
                    </p>
                    <ul style="color: rgb(218, 213, 213);">
                        <li>To <strong>reduce</strong> our consumption and reject the greed that drives destruction.</li>
                        <li>To <strong>repair</strong> what is broken — in our ecosystems and in our hearts.</li>
                        <li>To <strong>restore</strong> communion with our creaturely siblings and listen with reverence to their silent suffering.</li>
                        <li>To <strong>rejoice</strong> in the beauty that still remains and commit to protect it with tenderness.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p style="color: rgb(218, 213, 213);">
                        We must ask ourselves: What kind of footprint are we leaving behind? Are we pilgrims who bless the Earth with each step, or consumers who trample her under the weight of indifference?
                    </p>

                    <p style="color: rgb(218, 213, 213);">
                        Let us walk gently, dear brothers and sisters, for the ground beneath us is sacred. Let us labor with love, as humble caretakers, echoing the Canticle not just in song but in action. May this Jubilee be a new beginning — not only for the planet, but for our way of being in the world.
                    </p>

                    <p class="fw-bold text-warning">
                        Laudato si’, mi’ Signore!<br>
                        May we live these words not only with our lips, but with our lives.
